## Hey there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Ã‰lyse! 

_She/her ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ / Elle ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·_

DevOps gremlin (or mage, depends on the day) : breaking and (sometimes) fixing things.

### What I'm Into:
- **Rust** - at least I know I failed by getting yelled by a compiler instead of crashing things in production.
- **Nix** â€“ reproducible chaos, why not?
- **Kubernetes** â€“ love to hate it, hate to love it.
